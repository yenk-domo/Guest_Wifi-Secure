# Guest_Wifi-Secure
I'm not a developer just great at googling. don't be mad at me for this heavy but functional code.
Guest wireless LAN is never connected to work LAN.
You don't want your guest network (wifi) and our cable network to be connected on the same devices.

Prerequisite:
1-Install a first FTP server with a user and password.
2-Have an email address to receive the homemade software link.
